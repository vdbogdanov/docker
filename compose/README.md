If you want use service with custom config, you should change .env file in folder with service.

### [openvpn](services/openvpn/)

Deploy OpenVPN and generate .ovpn config on desktop.

Generate openvpn configuration:

```
docker compose run openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://<server_ip>:1194
```

Generate openvpn pki certificates:

```

Get openvpn client profile:

```
docker compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_getclient <client_name> > <client_name>.ovpn
```

### [nginx](services/nginx/)

Deploy Nginx as reverse proxy with HTTPS protocol. In my case for gitlab, pgadmin and vcenter docker containers, but you can change `/roles/nginx/files/templates/nginx.conf.template` according to your needs. Unlike previous nginx services, reverse proxy requires a domain name and certificates to establish an HTTPS connection (you can modify the nginx configuration to use the HTTP protocol). Certificates must be located in `/etc/letsencrypt` with names: `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`.

### [cmdbuild](services/cmdbuild/)

Deploy CMDBuild base on `http://<server_ip>:80/cmdbuild` where `username = cmdbuild` and `password = cmdbuild`.

### [gitlab](services/gitlab/)

Deploy Gitlab service on `http://<server_ip>:80` and `ssh_port = 2224` where `username = root`.

For get `password` you should run this command in terminal:

```
docker exec -it gitlab grep 'Password:' /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
```

### [pgadmin](services/pgadmin/)

Deploy pgAdmin on `http://<server_ip>:80` where `username = admin@github.com` and `password = admin`.

### [vcenter]()

Deploy vcsim - vcenter simulator in docker container `nimmis/vcsim`. If you want use it via HTTP, you should use official container. You can test connection on `https://<server_ip>:80/about`.
